# Toggl Reports

I track my working time in [Toggl][1].
I have to manually reconcile this time with our project management system every week.
The Toggl Weekly Detailed report _used_ to be available in decimal time, like the PM system requires, but that feature disappeared in early 2021.

I wrote this script to save myself some time.
